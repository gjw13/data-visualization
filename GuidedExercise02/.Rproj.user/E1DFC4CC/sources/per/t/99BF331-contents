# Introduction and Data

```{r load_data}
# Loading packages
library(tidyverse)

# Load data from CSVs
player_data <- read.csv("Master.csv")
pitching_data <- read.csv("Pitching.csv")
salary_data <- read.csv("Salaries.csv")
inflation_index <- read.csv("inflation.csv")
```

# Exercise 1

```{r exercise1}
head(pitching_data)

pitching_data$yearID <- as.factor(pitching_data$yearID)
pitching_data <- filter(pitching_data, !is.na(ERA))
ggplot(pitching_data) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=yearID,y=ERA))
```

Graph 1: This graph shows the distribution of ERAs for each year.

```{r graph2}
pitching_data$yearID <- as.factor(pitching_data$yearID)
summary_ERA <- summarize(group_by(pitching_data, yearID), Q1=quantile(ERA,.25,na.rm=T),median=median(ERA,na.rm=T),
                         Q3=quantile(ERA,.75,na.rm=T),min=min(ERA),max=max(ERA))
summary_ERA
summary_ERA$yearID <- as.numeric(as.character(summary_ERA$yearID))

ggplot(summary_ERA) + geom_line(aes(x=yearID,y=median))
```

Graph 2: This line graph shows how the median ERA has changed over time.

# Exercise 2

```{r ERA_Plot_3}
ggplot(summary_ERA) + geom_ribbon(aes(x=yearID,ymin=Q1,ymax=Q3),fill="lightgreen")+ geom_line(aes(x=yearID,y=median),color="darkblue")
```

Graph 3: This graph shows the range between the first and third quartiles as depicted by the green ribbon, with the median ERA as the dark blue line.

# Exercise 3

```{r graph4}

Graph 4: This graph displays the proportion of pitchers who had an ERA less than or equal to 3 and the proportion who had an ERA greater than or equal to 6.

Graph 5: This graph displays the salaries for the central 50% of earners divided between players who were born in the United States and who were born outside the United States.
